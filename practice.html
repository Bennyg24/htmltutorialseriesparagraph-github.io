  <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

  <p>
    I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Web Developer position at your organization. 
    Over the past year, I have developed hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, 
    and I’m passionate about building responsive and user-friendly web pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through my personal projects, I have created portfolio websites, landing pages, and small business sites 
    that demonstrate my attention to design and functionality. These experiences have strengthened my ability 
    to turn creative ideas into working digital solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am eager to continue growing as a developer and to contribute to a team that values innovation and learning. 
    Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how 
    I can support your company’s goals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sincerely,<br>
